controls:
wasd to move
right click to attack
when dead spacebar to restart

1-enviroment set up
used 2 assets packs from the asset store, one for the terrain and one for the buildings
3rd person camera made following a youtube guide using cinemachine
lighting from the asset pack looks fine so I didn't change it
added colliders to buildings preventing the player to walk through
main theme is medieval France

2-character and control
imported a 3d knight and set up the animation controller
implemented movement using player controller instead of rigid body since that's what the cinemachine tutorial used
attack and movement input are set

3-enemy AI and spawning
created enemy prefab that uses vectors
randomly spawn enemy with coroutine and an array of spawn points
enemy attack uses a trigger collision that damages player when entered
enemy dies when attacked by player attack also using trigger collision that appears when player attacks
no damage effect done but particle effect plays on player death

4-game mechanics
player has 100hp that goes down 10 every time enemy lands a hit
player's hp is displayed via the log after every hit
enemy spawns at random times and locations via coroutine and preset spawn points
player score is displayed in the log after every kill tracking how many kills the player gets
when player dies "game over" appears in logs and the player can restart with space bar

5-audio and effects
added audio listener and source for background music
particle effects play on player death

6-future concepts
used coroutines
